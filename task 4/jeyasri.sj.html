      <h3>chocolate  history
      </h3>
      <p>Cadbury is a British multinational confectionery company owned by Mondelēz International. It is the second largest confectionery brand in the world after Mars.[1] Cadbury is headquartered in Uxbridge, London, and operates in more than fifty countries worldwide. Its best known products include Dairy Milk chocolate</p>
      <p>In 1824, John Cadbury began to sell tea, coffee and drinking chocolate from his premises in Birmingham. Cadbury developed the business with his brother Benjamin, and later his sons Richard and George. George developed the Bournville estate, a model village designed to improve the living conditions of company employees. Dairy Milk chocolate, introduced in 1905, used a higher proportion of milk within the recipe compared with rival products. By 1914, the chocolate was the company's best-selling product.

      <h3>chocolate history 2</h3>
      <p> Soon after John Cadbury’s death, his sons Richard and George started handling the business when it was a rapid decline, and the company was losing the money. But in the year 1866, Cadbury retook the heights. This became possible only after they shifted the business from tea and coffee to chocolates. The duo also introduced improved cocoa into Britain.</p>
      <p>In the year `1905, in England, Cadbury launched its first Dairy Milk Bar with a very high proportion of milk. This bar turned out to be the company’s best selling bar in the year 1914. George Cadbury Junior, who was behind the development of this bar, said that a customer’s daughter suggested the name ‘Dairy Milk,’ which everyone liked for this renowned brand. It was a great sale due to which a Bournville Cocoa line was introduced in the year 1906.
