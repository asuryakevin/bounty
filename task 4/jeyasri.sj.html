Chakravarthi constructs a plan to send Bhoominathan away to Russia so that the students can be in a happy environment. Meanwhile, Chakravarthi meets Angu again, who also joins BEC.

      <p>Chakaravarthi successfully patches them up after he creates a short film and ends it on an emotional note that Angu's father and Angu get reunited. Angu is impressed and reciprocates his feelings. Amidst all of this, Bhoominathan unexpectedly returns from Russia, and discovers that Chakravarthi was the one who sent him to Russia. In revenge, he clicks a photo of Chakravarthi and Angu at the Taj Mahal and uses it to complain to Killivallavan, the chairman of BEC.

      <h3>S. J. Surya</h3>
      <p> Soon after John Cadbury’s death, his sons Richard and George started handling the business when it was a rapid decline, and the company was losing the money. But in the year 1866, Cadbury retook the heights. This became possible only after they shifted the business from tea and coffee to chocolates. The duo also introduced improved cocoa into Britain.</p>
      <p>In the year `1905, in England, Cadbury launched its first Dairy Milk Bar with a very high proportion of milk. This bar turned out to be the company’s best selling bar in the year 1914. George Cadbury Junior, who was behind the development of this bar, said that a customer’s daughter suggested the name ‘Dairy Milk,’ which everyone liked for this renowned brand. It was a great sale due to which a Bournville Cocoa line was introduced in the year 1906.
